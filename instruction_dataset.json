The center of gravity of the bowl is offset from the axis of rotation of the rotary coupler, and is preferably near the bottom of the bowl. This permits the bowl to always maintain a level orientation, regardless of whether the handle is rotated correctly, and regardless of whether the bowl is full or partially filled.\nSummary:  The invention is a spoon including a hand-grippable handle, a rotary coupler mounted to the handle, and a bowl mounted to the rotary coupler. The bowl is relatively rotatably mounted to the handle through the rotary coupler, permitting the bowl to remain level even if the handle is rotated. In a preferred embodiment, the center of gravity of the bowl is offset from the axis of rotation of the rotary coupler, and is most preferably near the bottom of the bowl. \n The center of gravity of the “bowl” is low enough that the bowl remains parallel with the ground regardless of the rotation of the handle.

The rotary coupler can be any coupler that permits rotary motion between two structures, including a simple bearing in which a shaft is rotatably mounted in a barrel in the manner of a door hinge, a coupler that uses ball bearings to form a much smoother bearing or an electromagnetic bearing. \n The invention prevents users from spilling the contents of the spoon if the users are not able to rotate their hands and wrists in the manner required with conventional spoons.

These improved gear legs use two composite materials. The first is very strong and flexible, allowing it to store a great deal of energy in a hard landing. These fibers are laid essentially parallel to the axis of the gear leg. The other fiber is very stiff, providing the torsional rigidity necessary to avoid flutter. The stiff fibers are laid at a large angle to the axis of the gear leg so their elastic limit is not exceeded during a hard landing.\nSummary:  The problem of heavy landing gear is solved by making the gear legs of a composite structure of two or more materials. One material, or group of materials, uses fibers with high yield strength and low modulus of elasticity, said fibers running essentially parallel to the axis of the gear leg. These are built into a structure that is much stronger than the present steel gear legs used on airplanes of similar weight. In this case, “stronger” means that it will not break of suffer permanent deformation in an impact that would leave the steel landing gear seriously bent, permanently. \n The second material, or group of materials, have moderate to high yield strength and high modulus of elasticity. These are incorporated into the matrix at angles far from the axis of the gear leg. These provide the torsional rigidity needed to suppress the tendency of the wheel and its fairing to flutter at high airplane speeds.\n\nGenerate claims:",

As the electrode melts during the welding operation, the shielding material is believed to prevent the manganese from vaporizing and oxidizing. As a result, more manganese resides in the weld deposit and less is present in the fume.

This process is advantageous because the fume contains significantly reduced levels of manganese. \n Another manifestation of the invention is a process for arc welding on low carbon steel substrate using an electrode including a core fill containing manganese wherein the fume contains less than 7% by weight of manganese. \n Another manifestation of the invention is a composite particle of manganese and shielding material that is useful in the electrode fill of a flux core welding electrode.\n\nGenerate claims:",

The invention allows the consumer of such soft drinks to safely re-seal the package after its been opened and the inner liquid partially consumed. The actual drinking straw will be affixed to the outside of the soft drink package similar to current packaging of soft package drinks without “The Z&G System.”\nSummary:  The idea of the instant invention is to allow consumers of soft container liquid drinks with straw holes to reseal the drink container when all of the drink has not been consumed, and the purchaser of the drink intends to save the remainder of the drink for later consumption. In the past, consumers of such soft container drinks were required to consume all of the drink once the container seal is brokend, or dispose of the unconsumed portion of the packaged drink. \n The invention exampled in “The E&G System” allows the consumer of soft packaged drinks with straw holes to reseal the drink after partial consumption by means of an internal pouch and internal zip-lock system. The object of “The Z&G System” invention and application allows the consumer to reseal his or her soft package drink after partial consumption, and thereby allows the consumer save the ramaining portion of the purchased drink for later consumption.

        "input": "Abstract: This process uses two catalysts instead of one, converting CO2 into C8H18. Addition of a NaCl catalyst to a Ni catalyst improves the efficiency of Fischer's process because the salt catalyst retains humidity. Furthermore, chlorine opens chemical chains and sodium prevents crystals of oxygen from covering the Ni catalyst. If we are equipped to produce CO2 from biogas or smoke, we can recycle this CO2 and yield a useful liquid. In fact, recycling CO2 into a synthetic crude hydrocarbon, octane, contributes to clean air and to produce a valuable source of energy. Because CO2 is a renewable resource, this process favors a lasting economic development.\nSummary:  There are many processes converting carbon dioxide into liquid synthetic hydrocarbon. Everybody knows that catalytic hydrogenation is feasible but its efficiency is problematic mostly because of the instability due to the unavoidable presence of oxygen and water vapor in the reactor. We also know that catalysts act as accelerators or as decelerators in chemical reactions without being part of the finished products. In converting carbon dioxide into liquid synthetic hydrocarbon through catalytic hydrogenation, the use of a nickel catalyst or other similar catalysts necessitates many manipulations which may affect expected output. CO2hydrocarbonation brings in a second catalyst, salt, which retains humidity. Furthermore, chlorine opens chemical chains and sodium prevents crystals of oxygen from covering the nickel catalyst. Doing so, the salt catalyst improves the action of the nickel catalyst. Catalytic hydrogenation of carbon dioxide becomes more regular and easier to standardize. CO2hydrocarbonation of carbon dioxide regularly produces 72% water and 28% octane. \n\nGenerate claims:",

        "input": "Abstract: A method for drying a material such as a polymer hydrogel which passes through a cohesive phase as it dries is disclosed. The method comprises agitating a composition while removing liquid until the solids content of the composition reaches a level at which the composition enters a cohesive phase, halting agitation, removing liquid from the composition in the absence of agitation, and resuming agitation. Practice of the present invention can eliminate the problems associated with adhesion of a material to itself and to process equipment during the cohesive phase.\nSummary:  This invention relates to a method for drying a material, such as a polymer hydrogel, that experiences a cohesive phase at certain levels of temperature and moisture content. This invention is based, in part, on the discovery that a material can be dried, in the absence of agitation, by applying a vacuum to the material as it passes through a cohesive phase. Thus, the invention allows for the suspension of agitation while a composition passes through its cohesive phase. \n The method of the present invention comprises agitating a composition comprising a solid and a liquid while removing the liquid until the solids content of the composition reaches a level at which the composition enters a cohesive phase, halting agitation, removing liquid from the composition in the absence of agitation, and resuming agitation. \n Consequently, practice of this invention can eliminate the problems associated with adhesion of the material to itself and to process equipment during the cohesive phase. Practice of the present invention can avoid the need for product back-mixing, for the use of azeotrope-forming solvents, or for the adding of agents that effect the surface wetting of the product. By avoiding these conventional drying techniques, the method of the present invention can help pharmaceutical manufacturers to maintain high purity standards and also to ensure batch integrity. Additionally, since agitation is suspended during the cohesive phase, practice of the present invention can avoid stress, strain, and damage to dryers that use mechanical agitation.\n\nGenerate claims:",

        "input": "Abstract: Disclosed is a method for the production of a planar textile structure, especially a woven belt band, especially for safety belts in motor vehicles, consisting of warp threads and at least one weft thread. The method is characterized in that at least one hybrid multi-filament thread, made up of at least first and second filaments, is used for weaving, said second filaments having a higher melting point than the first filaments. Flexible elliptical and flat interlacing points are formed during shed closing of the warp threads, and the belt band is thermofixed after weaving, whereby the first filaments melt and the second filaments of the multifilament yarn are at least partially glued together.\nSummary:  The invention relates to a method of producing a textile sheet fabric, particularly a woven webbing, more particularly a vehicle occupant restraint belt, comprising warp threads and at least one weft thread. \n A wide variety of methods of producing such webbing and their attendant disadvantages are known. As a rule, the warp threads thereof consist of multifil yarns whereas for the weft thread(s) multi- or monofil yarns are employed singly or in combination. Whilst making a webbing exclusively of multifil yarn for the weft thread material has the disadvantage of it having practically no CD stiffness and elasticity, webbing with weft threads of monofil material although featuring the desired CD and elasticity, suffer the disadvantage that after a certain number of chaffing actions the monofil weft threads at the edges where the weft returns, juts from the belt in forming a hard sawtooth-like woven edge damaging to the clothing of the vehicle occupant or even causing injury to the chest and neck of the occupant. By comparison, webbing made of monofil weft material is thick as compared to webbing made exclusively of multifil material. \n The invention is based on the object of proposing a method for producing a woven webbing which eliminates, or at least greatly reduces, the disadvantages known from prior art. This object is achieved by a method as it reads from claim 1. This method has the advantage that incorporating the hybrid multifil yarn in the weft now makes it possible to achieve the positive structures of the keying points in the woven.\n\nGenerate claims:",

        "input": "Abstract: Provided is a process for preparing a smooth and glossy surfaced paper web. The process comprises subjecting the paper web to shear by using calender rolls driven at different speeds or calender rolls with different diameters. The resulting paper has a totally different structure than the original paper, as it has a much smaller void structure and a much higher degree of bonding between the elements of the sheet. The process is particularly applicable to improving the electrical insulation properties of an aramid paper web.\nSummary:  The present invention provides a novel process for imparting a glossy and smooth surface to a paper web. The process of the present invention imparts shear to the surfaces of the paper web using calender rolls. In the shear calender process of the present invention, the surfaces of the web move at slightly different speeds. This is achieved by either driving the rolls at different speeds or by using rolls with different diameters. The shear calender paper is a novel product in that it has a new structure with a much higher degree of bonding between the elements of the sheet. The paper is denser, stronger, has a higher modulus, reduced equilibrium moisture content and smaller void structure than the original sheet. \n In another embodiment of the present invention, there is provided a better way to reduce the pore structure of aramid paper so that it has improved properties for electrical insulation. The present invention accomplishes this by glazing the aramid paper. It has been discovered that treating the aramid paper with a glazer at room temperature can reduce the pore volume and pore size. Glazers are available and any known glazer can be used. A glazer is a device that develops shear by compressing the paper between two different curved surfaces. It is preferred that this result of reducing the pore structure of aramid paper, however, \n be obtained by using a shear calender, which imparts shear to the surfaces of the paper web using calender rolls as described above. Using either technique, a key advantage of the present invention is that the process of reducing the pore structure by subjecting the aramid paper to shear can be conducted at ambient temperature, and the conventional heating step is not needed.\n\nGenerate claims:",

        "input": "Abstract: The nature of the Easy-Up-Ladder is to enhance the safety of the existing tree climbing stands. It is made to be able to climb up or climb down the ladder without having to jump. I thought of this idea because I personally hunt and had to jump up or jump down from my tree climbing stand. I designed this for myself and was told that there was a market for this invention.\nSummary:  The ladder will eliminate injury when climbing on the base of the tree climbing stand attached to the tree at a sharp acute angle. In this process of attaching the tree climbing stand up the tree two feet higher, the pressure of the base is forced down causing the base piece to bite into the tree giving the hunter a firm base to stand on as he climbs up or climbs down the tree. \n The ladder is folded in the base of the tree climbing stand and can be unfolded. When unfolded, the person has a 26″ ladder on which he can climb up or climb down the ladder and not have to jump onto or jump down from the stand. \n If a hunter finds a tree that is too large at the base, and becomes smaller two feet up, the hunter only has two choices. One choice is to attach the tree climbing stand at the bottom of the tree at a sharp angle. The second choice is to attach the tree climbing stand higher up the tree making a level platform. \n The invention is attached to the base of the tree climbing stand by a bracket.\n\nGenerate claims:",

As a result, the electrical system is capable of also powering a second electric motor that drives the spreader. Due to the improved efficiency of the conveyor belt system, increased conveying and spreading speed are possible as well as independent control over the operating speeds of the conveyor and spreader.\nSummary:  The present invention comprises a material spreading system for a truck comprising a conveyor and a spinner, each of which is powered by an electric motor that receives power from the vehicle's alternator/battery system. Since both electric motors are powered off the vehicle's battery there is limited amperage available for use by these motors. The conveyor drive system includes a high-efficiency gearbox or chain and sprocket system that translates about 90 to 95 percent of the power it receives into useful output, thus requiring less output from the power source (i.e., the battery) in order to provide predetermined levels of power of the conveyor than less efficient conveyor systems. \n Due to the decreased power draw of the conveyor drive, the spinner can be fully powered by its own dedicated electric motor that also draws from the vehicle's battery. Thus, the drive system of the present invention permits faster conveyor and spreader speeds than could be achieved using prior art drive systems, and permits independent control of the spinner and conveyor for more precisely controlled spreading of the hopper contents.\n\nGenerate claims:",

Having the first layer fastened to bridge support members in an oblique angle. With the second layer on top of the first layer and attached through first layer to bridge support members in the opposite oblique angle from the first layer.\nSummary:  A decking method for wooden bridges comprised of two layers of decking installed in an oblique angle to the main structural support members, with one layer in the opposite oblique angle from the other. \n Description—FIGS. 1&2 \n The typical embodiment of the invention as shown from above (FIG. 1), attached to any bridge support members of the common type constructed by those skilled in the art. Where in parts 1A & 1B are beams, stringers, or truss chord members, part 2 is any typical configuration of cross brace members, perpendicular to the main beams. Parts 3 & 4 are the two layers of diagonal wood decking fastened to the main supports by part 5. FIG. 2 is an end view at eye level showing the end grain of the main support beams (parts 1A&1B), part 2 is the cross beam with the two layer diagonal decking (parts 3 & 4) attached on top. \n Operation \n The function of two layer diagonal decking is to strengthen bridges laterally, and therefore gain overall strength and stability, while eliminating some of the traditional and inferior methods of lateral support, such as flying buttresses. This is accomplished by using two layers of decking in opposite oblique angles, as opposed to the typical one layer method installed transversely or longitudinally. This idea is found to be unobvious to those skilled in the art due to the bending modulus which in practice allows two layers of a given material to bend more than one layer of equal thickness. To correct for this extra bending the decking can be made thicker or the cross members can be closer together. This would typically use no more material than a bridge decked in the conventional style, due to the elimination of the former methods of diagonal bracing, resulting in a bridge that is 400%-800% stronger laterally. \n\nGenerate claims:",

        "input": "Abstract: The R.V.H. (Rotary Valve Head) is a three way valve system designed to replace the head and valve train of four stroke combustion engines. Valve opperations are carried out with one rotating component. This is accomplished by rotating a cylinder with a concave inside a chamber with three openings. These openings are the intake, exhaust and combination ports. The combination port and cylinder form the top of the combustion chamber. Two main benefits result. Less energy is consumed in this system than traditional valve systems. Also, larger chambers can be utilized for the flow of gasses into and out of the combustion chamber.\nSummary:  The R.V.H. is comprized of three primary components. A base and cover fit together to form the intake and exhaust ports. A rotor fits between the base and cover. The rotor is driven by a timing belt at half the speed of the crank shaft. As it spins, a concave in the rotor opens the intake and exhaust ports in time with the movement of the piston(s). The ports are closed by a cylindrical portion of the rotor. \n The R.V.H. replaces the head(s) and cam and eliminates the lifters, push rods, rocker arms and valves of traditional engines. The R.V.H. does not work against the resistance of valve springs and replaces reciprocal motion with more efficient centripital motion. Therefore, the R.V.H. consumes less energy. An additional benefit is the elimination of valve float at high RPM's. \n The R.V.H. minimizes restrictions to flow. Nearly the entire top of the cylinder opens to allow the filling and expelling of gasses. The ports are also larger, with reduced angles. By increasing flow, the R.V.H. increases the yield of internal combustion engines.\n\nGenerate claims:",

        "input": "Abstract: The electro-charger revolutionizes the after market automotive industry because it can be applied to any gasoline engine with considerably less complications than a turbo or super-charger. The electro-charger is easier to control than turbo and super-chargers therefore it is safer to use. Since the electro-charger does not require any power from the engine in the form of exhaust gases or beltdrive systems, it increases the power output of an engine greater than that of a turbo or super-charger with equal pounds of boost.\nSummary:  This is where the electro-charger differs from turbo and super-chargers. The electro-charger is basically a centrifugal compressor driven solely by it's own electric motor. The motor is powered by a power inverter, which converts D/C to A/C, and steps the A/C voltage up to 120 volts at approximately 12 amps*. This voltage is then sent through a selector switch which controls the voltage reaching the motor of the electro-charger, in turn controlling the speed at which it rotates, this is a type of “boost control”. Fuel enrichment is handled the same typical way as with a turbo or super-charger's FMU**. The electro-charger is a unit that can be mounted on almost any vehicle with the right fuel upgrades and is easier/cheaper to install than a turbo or super-charger. The electro-charger takes none of the engines horsepower because it is driven by voltage not belts or exhaust gasses. The electro-charger is switch activated therefore, it operates only at the driver's discretion so an engine still get great gas mileage when performance is not needed, unlike a turbo or super-charger. In a boost for boost comparison the electro-charger produces more power, is easier to control, and is more engine efficient than either a turbo or super-charger. *The voltage (12VDC) is supplied by the vehicle's battery. **FMU stands for Fuel Management Unit, which increases fuel pressure as boost rises. \n\nGenerate claims:",

Direct transport of digital radiographic image into a computer and production of an output image, enlarged to window size, on a computer monitor makes it hard to figure out a precise measurement of a tooth or other vital structures. In addition to this, various kind of distorted of images are produced depending on the position of the radiographic sensor. A distorted image is created due to 1) an angulations and 2) position of the sensor. Angulations of the sensor lead to a radiograph that is expanded or shrunken, laterally or vertically. Such a distorted image is seen when using the bisecting technique and causes significant error when the clinician is trying to measure length between critical structures. The purpose of the current invention is to correct angulation's error due to sensor's position, and allow a clinician to precisely measure the distance from point A to point B with a click of a mouse. \n A dental X-ray image sensor provided with a radio-opaque cross-mark on the corner of a digital radiograph sensor surface is provided to enable a computer program to recognize true dimension and to rescale any distortion due to angulation's position error in a conventional X-ray digital radiograph system. \n\nGenerate claims:",

Harmonization is known for adaptation of the dynamic range in 2-D x-ray imaging and mammography for the purpose of optimally compensating the various tissue thicknesses (and thereby compensating global image brightenings) in an x-ray image in order to generate an equally-distributed image brightness for the diagnosis. The invention is based on the general idea of a symptomatic artifact correction, in contrast to conventional methods that focus, often a very elaborate manner, or the causes for cupping artifacts. It has been shown that artifacts of the type discussed herein can be eliminated or reduced by the use of a harmonization method that is known for other purposes, at least insofar as that the visualization of an image data set allows a reliable diagnosis. The harmonization is advantageously (because it is possible with relatively low calculation outlay) effected in 2D image data sets or a 3D reconstruction. It is also possible to implement the harmonization in the voxel data of a 3-D image data set.

The surface of the convex suspension rim is overlaid with an elastic layer so that a better vibration form and a preferred tone quality could be outputted, and thereby, it is possible to alleviate the elastic fatigue and spoilage of the cone and control damping and value Q of the loudspeaker.\nSummary:  Since a paper cone of a conventional loudspeaker is generally peripherally fixed to a speaker frame through adhering a suspension rim, a poor adhering job is liable to deteriorate the precision and symmetry of the paper cone such that torsion is created to affect the tone quality of the loudspeaker accordingly. Besides, the juncture between the paper cone and the suspension rim may break or fracture easily due to the high frequency vibration of the paper cone. \n To overcome the above-mentioned defects, the present invention proposes an integrally formed paper cone with a better symmetry, whose outer verge is expanded to form a suspension rim overlaid with an elastic layer such that damping and value Q of the loudspeaker can be controlled. \n The merits of the present invention may be summarized as follows: (1) Better tone quality and vibration form is obtained due to the integrally molded paper cone. (2) Elastic fatigue of the suspension rim is alleviated. (3) The damping and value Q of a loudspeaker can be controlled easily by overlaying some layers on the surface of the suspension rim surrounding the paper cone. \n For more detailed information regarding advantages or features of the present invention, at least one example of preferred embodiment will be described below with reference to the annexed drawings.\n\nGenerate claims:",

One type of wax guard comprises a cylinder with a flange and a bridge that spans the flange, covering the opening of the cylinder. Over time however wax does work its way under the bridge and into the cylindrical portion of the wax guard and at some point the wax guard must be replaced to insure the passage of sound. \n Since the wax guard is a fairly small component, a tool is provided to transfer the wax guard from its packaging to the receiver tube of the hearing instrument. A tool having a pair of opposing, spaced-apart elements exhibiting a degree of spring-like action is placed on the top of the bridge of the wax guard. The tool is then pushed downwardly to force apart the opposing elements so that they will slip under the bridge. Protrusions on the opposing elements of the tool enhance the tool's ability to maintain a grasp underneath the bridge. Next, the tool is lifted, pulling the wax guard out of the holder and then guides the wax guard into the end of a receiver tube. The tool can then be removed from the wax guard by sliding the tool laterally along a fine defined by the span of the bridge. The spring action of the tool allows the elements move apart and clear the bridge while insuring that the wax guard remains seated in the receiver tube.\n\nGenerate claims:",

        "input": "Abstract: The invention concerns a method for the production of a connecting flange. The object of the present invention is to propose a method with which the production of an annular connection flange, in particular a connection flange as is described in DE 101 26 049, is improved and simplified. A method for the production of an annular connection L-flange, wherein the annular flange is produced from an element in the form of a circular ring and the element in the form of a circular ring is of a substantially triangular configuration in cross-section profile.\nSummary:  The invention is based on the realization that, at its free end, the flange collar has to transmit only relatively low forces and possibly even no forces at all. Therefore in terms of the strength and the stability of the connection flange, it is harmless if the thickness of the flange collar at its free end is less than in the region where the flange collar forms a transition into the tubular portion. That can also provide that the starting material which can be used for production of the connection flange is not for example just a segment in the form of a circular ring which is of a substantially rectangular cross-sectional configuration, but it can also be substantially of a triangular cross-section. \n The particular advantage is that in that way the cutting or turning operations for producing the connection flange from the semifinished product are considerably reduced. When the semifinished product is of a substantially triangular cross-section, it is also markedly better than a previous semifinished product because at the initial stage the semifinished product does not need to have as much material as hitherto.

        "input": "Abstract: A forging blank for a golf club head is made by casting and includes at least one bending portion, a club head portion extending from an end of the bending portion, and a hosel portion extending from the other end of the bending portion. The angled bending portion of the forging blank reduces the deformation of the forging blank during a forging step that fills cinder holes in the forging blank. A golf club head can be manufactured with fewer forging molds without sacrificing the structure of the golf club head.\nSummary:  In accordance with an aspect of the present invention, a forging blank for a golf club head is made by casting and comprises at least one bending portion having a first end and a second end, a club head portion extending from the first end of said at least one bending portion, and a hosel portion extending from the second end of said at least one bending portion. \n Preferably, each of the club head portion and the hosel portion has a substantially circular section. \n In an embodiment of the invention, the club head portion of the forging blank has a sectional area greater than that of the hosel portion. The club head portion of the forging blank is forged to form a body of a golf club head, with the body having a striking face. \n In another embodiment of the invention, the club head portion of the forging blank has a sectional area smaller than that of the hosel portion. The club head portion of the forging blank is forged to form a striking portion of a golf club head. A weight member is bonded to a rear side of the striking portion to form a body of the golf club head. \n The forging blank may be made of a Fe—Mn—Al alloy, an AISI 4130 steel, or an AISI 8620 steel. \n Other objects, advantages and novel features of this invention will become more apparent from the following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.\n\nGenerate claims:",
